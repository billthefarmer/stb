# Sussex Tune Book

The [stb_book.pdf](stb_book.pdf) file printed out double sided and
bound on the short edge makes up a landscape A4 book.

The [stb_booklet.pdf](stb_booklet.pdf) file printed out double sided,
stapled in the centre of the pages, and folded, makes up an A5
booklet.

The [stb.zip](stb.zip) file contains all the files below, and scripts
to build the pdf files from [stb.abc](stb.abc). You will need abc2ps,
ghostscript, psutils, and gnuwin32 to build them on windows. Most of
that comes for free with linux.
